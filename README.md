We performed an observational synthesis of soil fractionation data constituting 1,144 globally-distributed soil profiles from 78 studies that reported fractionation and bulk measurements of organic carbon across depths. This dataset includes measurements of mineral-associated, particulate, and bulk soil organic carbon, as well as ancillary data on edaphic, climate, and vegetation characteristics. We also performed a separate observational synthesis of soil carbon accrual from manipulation and chronosequence studies, which included changes in carbon stocks or concentrations, bulk density, experimental duration, and edaphic properties. Further details for both syntheses can be found in the methods and supplementary materials of the manuscript. A permanent DOI for these data can be found on Zenodo:

We then leveraged these data along with ancillary data on climate, vegetation, and soil characteristics to produce spatially-explicit global estimates of mineral-associated soil organic carbon stocks (MOC) and mineralogical carbon capacity (MOC<sub>max</sub>) in non-permafrost, non-desert mineral soils. Globally-gridded datasets are given in kgC/m<sup>2</sup> for topsoil (0-30cm) and subsoil (30-100cm) at 0.5&deg; spatial resolution.
